# _Testing Objects_

#### _A program to allow me to practice storing creating and storing objects_

#### By _**Hassan Al-khalifah**_

## Description

_The website is designed as a way for me to practice creating new objects, storing and instance of each new objected created and using them to manipulate the DOM. By using the aforementioned, I created a simple game of chance, which has two players. Each player has a turn to stab the other, by targeting that specific players object, I was able to achieve a back and forth sequence that jumps between players turns and they battle it out._
